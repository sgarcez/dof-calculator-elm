# Depth Of Field calculator in Elm

Simple implementation of a DOF calculator in Elm, mainly to try out the language.

It takes 3 inputs (distance, focal length and aperture) and calculates 3 output values (near point, far point, range)

You can try it here: [https://sgarcez.github.io/dof-calculator-elm/]()

### TODO:
- Float toString precision
- sensor/coc input
